Model Viewer README

Overview
Model Viewer is an interactive 3D visualization application built with React and @react-three/fiber. It enables users to explore and interact with a 3D model, providing dynamic UI elements for actions such as zooming, opacity adjustments, and progress tracking. The application integrates Framer Motion for smooth animations and a modern, responsive UI.

Features

3D Model Interaction:
Zoom in/out functionality with smooth transitions.
Adjustable model opacity during interactions.

Dynamic UI Components:
Progress tracking with animated action and risk cards.
Floating navigation buttons for additional functionality.

Modern Design:
Responsive layout with a clean and minimalistic interface.
Smooth animations powered by Framer Motion and @react-spring/three.

Technologies Used
React: Component-based frontend development.
@react-three/fiber: Framework for rendering 3D scenes in React.
@react-three/drei: Utility helpers for common 3D tasks.
Framer Motion: For animations and transitions.
@react-spring/three: For spring-based animations in 3D.
Lucide Icons: Lightweight, modern SVG icons.
